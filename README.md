# Oddball

This folder contains 3 types of Oddball experiment.

1) PhasicTonic: 

Goal: Test both the effects of the tonic and phasic levels on the pupil size. 
Task: The non dominant hand squeezes the dynamometor with different amount of strength. The required strength is determined by 
a vertical line that changes position every 10 trials. The subject has to bring the dot to the vertical line and hold the grip.
The different level of strength are: no strength (washout period of 10 trials every 10 trials), 5%,10%,15%,20%,25% and 30% of 
the maximal strength of the subject. 

The dominant hand squeezes (shortly) the dynamometer when the oddball tone comes up. As
the subject squeezes the dynamometer, a cercle grows, it has to fit/reach the outer circle around the fixation point.
