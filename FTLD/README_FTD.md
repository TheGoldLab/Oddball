# Novel oddball task with FTD patients

__Task:__

Patients do three blocks of 160 trials. There are 3 types of sounds: oddball tone, standard tone and novel sounds (in wav 
folder). In the first block, they squeeze hard with both hands when the oddball tone comes up. 
In the second block, they squeeze light with both hands when the oddball tone comes up. In the third block, they squeeze 
light with both hands when the standard tone comes up. 

__Files:__

'oddballRun_Patients.m' is the main script that call 'oddballConfig_Patients.m' that contains the details of the paradigm.

'oddballRun_PRETEST.m' and 'oddballConfig_PRETEST.m' don't work with the eyetracker, these are the files to use to train 
the subjects to the task.
